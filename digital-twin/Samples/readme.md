# Azure IoT Digital Twins SDK Samples

The Digital twin samples that previously existed here have been removed since the Digital Twin feature is now formally released and has a new set of samples to match. 

Please see here for the up to date [device samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-java/tree/main/device/iot-device-samples/pnp-device-sample) and for the [service samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-java/tree/main/service/iot-service-samples/digitaltwin-service-samples)
